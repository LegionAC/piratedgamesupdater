HOW TO USE:
To use this repo, download the zip, extract the files, and go to config.txt
Once there, newfile will be the location of the folder that you want to copy from, for example, newfile=path/to/folder
Old file will be the folder that you want to update, for example, oldfile=path/to/folder.
Save that in the txt, and then run update.bat in the Update folder.
